                <h3>Who</h3>
                <p>
                    My name is Johannes. I'm 20-years-old second year computer science student from Turku.
                    I've been coding web pages and computer programs in Java and Python since I was 14 years old.
                    I like to spend my freetime coding and reading non-fiction books.
                </p>

                <h3>Been There Done That</h3>
                <p>
                    In addition being crazy for coding, there are also many other things
                    I like to do. I've photographed nature, landscape, people and products
                    for over 6 years now. Shooting video has been around for two years now. 
                    Music is close to my heart. I've played bass for 6 years and violin for 11 years.
